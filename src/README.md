# The backend of Blast

- `reconciler.ts` is the custom React renderer that utilizes the `react-reconciler` package.
- Inside `raycast` folder, I tried to implement the Raycast APIs in my own way. Some of them are not implemented yet.
- `elements` included the React Elements that are used in `reconciler.ts`. The folder and file naming structure is based on <https://github.com/clayrisser/create-react-renderer>
