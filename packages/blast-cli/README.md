# `@blastlauncher/cli`

`@blastlauncher/cli` is a command line tool that used to build and publish Blast Launcher extensions.

I somehow discover that Raycast's extension build output are similar to esbuild's output, so I also use esbuild to bundle the extension and pkg to package the cli executable. Ray's CLI is way smaller, I guess their CLI is written in Go. ðŸ¤£

The publish command will upload the extension to npm registry(which is released under `@blast-extensions` for now).

You can learn more about the extension publishing in the [raycast-extensions-mirror](https://github.com/BlastLauncher/raycast-extensions-mirror/blob/main/.github/workflows/extensions_build_publish.yaml) repo.
