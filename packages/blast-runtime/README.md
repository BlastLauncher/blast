# `@blastlauncher/runtime`

`@blastlauncher/runtime` is the runtime of Blast Launcher.

In Raycast Launcher, you can build extensions in React.js. In Blast Launcher, we're taking this idea furthur. The **whole application** is build in React.js.

The Launcher itself is a huge React.js application, and the extensions are also React.js components. Wrap components inside components, just regular React.js things, right?
