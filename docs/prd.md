# Blast - Project Requirements Documentation

## 1. App Overview

Blast is an open-source launcher application that implements and supports Raycast's extension system. It uniquely demonstrates the flexibility of Raycast's API by using the same components and patterns to build both the launcher interface and run extensions.

**Project Goals:**
- Create a launcher that supports Raycast extensions
- Build the launcher itself using Raycast API patterns
- Provide cross-platform support through Node.js
- Enable seamless developer transition from Raycast
- Support multiple frontend implementations beyond Electron

## 2. User Flow

1. **Launcher Operation:**
   - Main interface built with Raycast components
   - Extension loading and management
   - Command discovery and execution

2. **Extension Development:**
   - Developers write extensions using Raycast API
   - Components use custom React renderer
   - Same patterns as launcher development

3. **Runtime Flow:**

   - State synchronization
   - Event system reliability
   - Extension isolation

2. **API Compatibility:**
   - Raycast API changes
   - Feature parity challenges
   - Platform limitations
   - Extension compatibility

3. **Development Complexity:**
   - React renderer maintenance
   - Cross-platform testing

   - Event queue management
   - State update frequency
   - Memory usage in extensions
   - UI rendering performance

The design creates a launcher that not only supports Raycast extensions but demonstrates the versatility of Raycast's component patterns by using them to build its own interface. This unified approach ensures consistency in behavior and development experience across both the launcher and its extensions.
